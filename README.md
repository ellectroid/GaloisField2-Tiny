# GaloisField2-Tiny
Tiny Experimental Galois Field 2 Project (Degree, multiplication, reduction)

Does GF(2) multiplication, polynomial reduction and degree. Inputs and outputs of degree up to around LONG_MAX (more than enough for any real practical purpose).

Fully C-compatible code. No standard library used. In theory, should run on a 1980 toaster.

This repository contains the library and its test with multiple polynomials.
